# Dynamically Load a Custom Element

A custom element can be built easy enough, but how to dynamically load it? This 'proof of concept' will try to answer that question.

## Quick Start

1. `npm ci`
2. `npm run start`
3. Open https://localhost:5000/sample-custom-element.html.
    - You __should__ see text "I am content for a sample element."
4. Open https://localhost:5000/.
    - You __hope__ to see text "I am content for a sample element."
